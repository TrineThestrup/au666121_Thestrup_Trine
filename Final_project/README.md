About our project

In this project we examine abortion rates in Denmark since 1973 by using data from Sundhedsdatastyrelsen and Danmarks Statistik on abortion. By using R markdown in R Studio we have been to visualize our data on the number of abortions in Denmark from 1973 to 2022 and the number of women from 1973 to 2022, as well as a plot showing in which weeks the abortions were performed from 1973 to 2022.
